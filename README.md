## About

This website was created as a personal brand / portfolio showcase, as well as a way for me to 
practice web development. <br>
I originally started with vue.js, but realized it as a little heavy for a project
as simple as this, and switched over to regular HTML, CSS, and minimal javascript. 

## Challenges

### Design 

UI/UX design is really hard. My original intent was to create
an expansive space-themed design, but somehow my mockups always ended up a little boring or 
childish. It's now still a little childish, but more in line with what I wanted. <br>
At one point, I experimented with parallax, but this ended up being too tacky. <br>

### Insights

I started with the belief that I needed many libraries and frameworks to get my 
website to look and feel modern. But I've realized that plain CSS and Javascript can 
get the job done in most cases, and most projects don't really need a lot of dependencies. 
Even responsive design can be solved with CSS flexbox, without bootstrap.
